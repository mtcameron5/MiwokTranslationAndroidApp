Miwok App
===================================

This application is written in Java. This app displays lists of vocabulary words for the user to learn the Miwok language. The list of vocabulary words are broken down into four activities with corresponding fragments. The MediaPlayer API, ASync API, and Fragment API are all used in this application. Through the MediaPlayer API audio playback is used while allowing for interruptions from alternative applications, the ASync API is used in order to allow multithreading, and the Fragment API allows the usage of more complex interfaces.
